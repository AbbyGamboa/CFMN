                <p>In the 1960s and 70s, the United States saw an impressive number of women’s rights activist groups emerge. One such group addressed the intersectional identity of being a Chicana in the United States. According to the records of  UC Santa Barbara’s public library, the Comisión Feminil Mexicana Nacional was established after a group of Chicana feminists spoke on Chicana issues at the National Chicana Issues Conference. The group’s concerns and call for action were disregarded by the male-dominated conference. 

                    From that 1970s conference emerged the idea and creation of the Comision Feminil Mexicana Nacional, a group composed of Chicana activists who sought to improve the lives of individual Chicanas and the greater Chicano community. Some of the comisions contributions are listed in the timeline below, take a look!

            <h1>Praxis</h1>
            
                <p>Women in the Chicano movement saw a need for change regarding the treatment and rights of Chicanas, the likes of which the Chicano movement was not advocating for. Likewise, when approaching the women’s rights activist groups of the 1960s and 1970s, they saw no address of the experience of Latin American people of color. The CFMN was established from the underrepresentation of Chicanas in both groups. The founders of CFMN addressed issues of Chicana success, immigration rights, blue-collar workers’ rights, and equality between Chicanas and Chicanos. Through their lived experiences, the women of the Comisión established much-needed community centers that assisted unemployed Chicanas, working mothers, immigrants, and Chicano youth. The work of the CFMN relates to a term called feminist praxis, which stems from feminist/ feminism and praxis. Feminism is defined as a form of advocacy that is based on the ideology that all people should not be subject to the implications of the patriarchy and deserve equal treatment regardless of gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and race. Praxis is the process of changing activism based on new knowledge in a particular theory. In this example of the Comisión, there were no organizations that embodied the identity of a Chicana, so Chicanas made one. The Chicano Movement may have disregarded its sisters, but Chicanas adapted and pivoted their activism to address their needs and wants as Mexicanas in America. </p>
